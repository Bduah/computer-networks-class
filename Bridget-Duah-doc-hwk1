Overview of Application

The client takes in inputs from the user and send it to the server for processing.
This application allows users to add items(strings) to a storage, remove items from the storage and also get 
a list of all the characters that appear in every string in the storage.
After the client connects with the server, the client asks the user for an input.
The client user allows the user to enter inputs as many times as they want until the enter in "quit".
The first input, called cmd takes in a string:
1 means the user want to perform an add request.
2 means the user want to perform a deletion request.
3 means the user wants to perform a "return appear in all" request.
"quit" means the user what to close the application.
If the user enters anything outside of these sets of inputs, 
we print out "INVALID INPUT" and the user can enter another input.

After the first input, we ask a second input based on the the first input.
If the user enters 1, we ask the user what item they want to add.
If the user enters 2, we ask the user what item they want to delete.
If the user enters 3, we don't ask for a second input. 

The message is now sent to the server for processing.
In the server, if the user wanted to add an item, we add the item to the storage.
If the user wanted to remove an item, we try to remove the item if it is in the storage, 
else we throw an error saying the item doesn't exist in the storage.
If the user wanted to return all the characters that appear in the storage, 
we go through every item, check the character that appears in all the items and then return a list of 
those characters.


Client->Server Message Format
The client get the msg in the format, msg(string) = cmd + item and send it to the server.


Server->Client Message Format
The server splits the msg from client into cmd and item and perform the necessary processes.
After the processing, the server sends a response to the client, and throws an error if necessary.
