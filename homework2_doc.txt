Edits
Try catch block for splitting the message from the client in the server
Return code 10 for invalid message requests from the client
Error code 9 means the user is not logged in yet but is trying to do a transaction
Used in the server when trying to get account balance, deposit, withdrawal
Used in client when interpreting codes from the server in the process deposit, get the balance
The client does not have to send the account number each time it sends a request message for a client. 
The server keeps track of active accounts when a new account is logged in. 
This account will be used in all the transactions with the active client/account.
Added message types from server to client for the client to know what type of message it is getting from the server.

Examples of each message type defined
Login
Client
request = f"LOGIN {acct_num} {pin}"
acct_num refers to the account number
pin refers to the pin of the account
LOGIN is used to notify the server that a login action has to be done


Server
response = “0” or “1” or “2” or “3” or “4”


Check Balance
Client
request = f"GETBALANCE {acct_num}"
acct_num refers to the account number
GETBALANCE is used to notify the server that a get balance action has to be done


Server
response = account_balance
Account balance refers to the account balance, e.g. $1024.32
Deposit
Client
Input “d”
request = f"DEPOSIT {acct_num} {amt}"
acct_num refers to the account number
amt refers to the amount in the transaction
DEPOSIT is used to notify the server that deposit action has to be done


Server
return_response = str(response[1]) + " " + str(response[2])
response[1] is a status code. If the code is 1, it means the amount provided for the deposit was invalid. 
If the code is 0, it means that the deposit was successful
response[2] is the account balance.


Withdrawal
Client
Input “w”
request = f"WITHDRAW {acct_num} {amt}"
acct_num refers to the account number
amt refers to the amount in the transaction
WITHDRAW is used to notify the server that a withdrawal action has to be done
Server
return_response = str(response[1]) + " " + str(response[2])
response[1] is a status code. If the code is 1, it means the amount provided for the deposit was invalid. 
If the code is 0, it means that the deposit was successful. If the code is 2, 
it means there was an attempted overdraft.
response[2] is the account balance.


Preventing bank account access from more than one atm_client at a time
To prevent bank access from more than one ATM client at a time, we used a global dictionary 
data structure to keep track of active accounts called ACTIVE_ACCOUNTS. In order to do this, 
we utilized the data object in the accept_wrapper() function to keep track of the client network address. 
When there is a successful connection between the client and the server, 
the network address is stored in the data object. When a user tries to log in, 
the server first checks if the account number and PIN are valid. If they are valid, 
it checks whether the account exists in the server and if the account is active, 
that is, it is in the ACTIVE_ACCOUNTS dictionary. If it is, then a response of code 4 is sent back to 
the client which prints out the message that the account is already logged in. 
If the account is not in the ACTIVE_ACCOUNTS dictionary and exists in the server’s data, 
it is added to the ACTIVE_ACCOUNTS dictionary, and the response code 0 is sent to the client which 
prints the message of a successful log-in. When a connection is lost, the server does not receive 
a message from the client. The server then deletes the account from the ACTIVE_ACCOUNTS dictionary 
which allows other clients to now log-in to this account.
